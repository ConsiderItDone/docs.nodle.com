# Ecosystem

## Nodle and its place in the Polkadot ecosystem
Nodle has been implementing a long-term vision to be a part of the Polkadot ecosystem, the foundation of the future of the internet. Its already-running blockchain (2,000,000 blocks and counting) built on Substrate, the language of the Polkadot ecosystem.
Nodle plans to leverage the radical interoperability of the Polkadot ecosystem alongside its patented, cutting-edge advances in cryptography to build a more open, secure, and decentralized internet.
The future of the internet is Web 3.0. Dr. Gavin Wood, the founder of Polkadot, believes that Web 3.0 is not only about new ways of communicating, but also new ways of ensuring that communications are trustworthy.
That communication is increasingly happening not only person-to-person or person-to-computer but between computers. Think about smart homes, self-driving cars, augmented and virtual reality systems: all of these rely on the communication of sensors and the transfer of information in real-time. The Nodle Network offers a protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT) to securely communicate, alongside a blockchain that ensures the security and usefulness of that data.

## What is Polkadot?
The [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/getting-started) describes Polkadot as, “built to connect and secure unique blockchains, whether they be public, permissionless networks, private consortium chains, or oracles and other Web3 technologies. It enables an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information under common security guarantees.”

## What is DOT?
DOT is the native token of Polkadot. DOT holders can lock their tokens for two years with a project like Nodle and receive NODL rewards. DOT can also be used to pay for Polkadot functions like parathreads.

## What is NODL?
NODL: Native token of the Nodle Network. Users of the Nodle Cash app and the Nodle SDK earn NODL by sharing their device’s connectivity. Institutions, businesses, governments and developers who want to use the Nodle Network to relay data pay for services in Nodle.

## Why Substrate? 
Nodle being built on Substrate (Polkadot) is vital to the success of the project and the mission we are trying to achieve - interconnecting the world would simply not be possible on Ethereum, as an example, due to slow transaction times, high transaction costs, (more points) making this project near impossible. We aim to offer the exciting functionality of subscription-based models to our user base that would simply not be possible using other available technology. We tried Stellar but overwhelmed their network with our transaction volume, Nodle would not have been sustainable on that platform long term, with Polkadot, these efficiencies and reduced costs are shared onto the users who enjoy the benefits of passive income through Nodle cash. 
Nodle provides the Internet of things (IoT) with a secure data gateway (route of travel) for data to reach the blockchain in a seamless yet decentralized way, through the use of our Nodle node network. Nodle gathers information from IoT hardware which Nodle aims to connect every device to the blockchain. There are no limitations, every device can be fitted with a low-cost Bluetooth Low Energy sensor using a method of applications, and with Nodle’s unique patented infrastructure (simply the Nodle Cash app) information can be gathered from ground-level data assets, transmitted through the Nodle network and stored on the blockchain. 
The use cases for Nodle will revolutionize the way we live our lives for the better, living in a more energy-conserving, sustainable and smart way. At Nodle we give developers the platform to make their vision a reality, we provide decentralized infrastructure for smart city developers to test and push the boundaries of what is possible.
