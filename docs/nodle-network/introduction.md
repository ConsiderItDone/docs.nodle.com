# Introduction

The **Nodle Network** is a decentralized wireless network, composed of Nodle Edge Nodes,
powered by the Nodle Chain, and the NODL token

## Introduction

The Nodle Network is designed to offer a global, easy to use, decentralized communications network for IoT devices. The Nodle networking stack is a software solution to monetize hardware and IoT devices.With Nodle, Network Contributors share their communications resources to enable connectivity for the network. These Contributors become part of a shared, interoperable “Citizen Network,” and are incentivized to scale the network through a Proof of Connectivity™ algorithm. This Proof of Connectivity algorithm is based on the number of base stations, network bandwidth, and geographic coverage. The Nodle Network is deployed via the addition of software running on wireless devices such as smartphones, routers, fixed base stations, drones, vehicles, and other connected devices. Through an economy of connectivity and decentralized infrastructure, the Nodle Network provides a low cost, global, scalable connectivity solution enabling many services to be built on top of the Network.

### How does the Nodle Network work?

The Nodle Network`s architecture and system design leverage what is called “The Smartphone Infrastructure”,
utilizing smartphones as nodes and base stations for the network. The team at Nodle has developed an
innovative way to grow the network through “proof of connectivity”. Using this method, mobile application
developers and consumers compete and participate in the network by enabling their smartphones to provide resources
such as wireless radio and bandwidth, and in exchange for their contribution, get rewarded with Nodle Cash.
